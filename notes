Issues:
0: read_number -> 0x, 1., 1e, 1e+, 1.e, 1.e+ are all taken valid numbers
1: read_string -> """"" = """"""; 5times " je valid empty multiline string
2: read_string -> """a""" saved as "a
3: read_string -> \xaz is valid but shouldn't? the 'z' is scrapped
4: read_string -> string with unexpected EOL or EOF shouldn't be valid
--------------------
Solutions:
1 & 2: read_string -> multiline check -> if(true) ->
       advance(scanner) should be 3times
